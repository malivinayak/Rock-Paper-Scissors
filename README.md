# Rock Paper Scissors 

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game! This is a simple game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Rock Paper Scissors is a fun game that everyone knows how to play. 
This web application allows you to play against the computer and keep score of your wins and losses.

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply click on one of the three buttons to choose your move: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`. The computer will then randomly select its move, and the winner will be determined according to the following rules:

* Rock beats scissors
* Scissors beats paper
* Paper beats rock
If both the player and the computer choose the same move, it's a tie.
